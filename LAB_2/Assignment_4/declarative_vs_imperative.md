# Declarative vs. Imperative UI Testing

## 1. Explanation

**Declarative UI Testing:**
- Focuses on describing the desired outcome or state of the UI, rather than the specific steps to achieve it.
- Example: `cy.contains('Add').should('be.visible')` (Cypress checks if the 'Add' button is visible, regardless of how it got there).
- Test cases read like specifications: "The to-do item should be visible after adding."
- Benefits: More readable, maintainable, and closer to user requirements.

**Imperative UI Testing:**
- Specifies the exact sequence of actions to perform in the UI.
- Example: `cy.get('input').type('Task'); cy.contains('Add').click();`
- Test cases are step-by-step instructions: "Type in the input, then click 'Add'."
- Benefits: More control over the test flow, useful for complex interactions.

## 2. Discussion: Which Approach is More Applicable?

- **Declarative testing** is generally preferred for UI tests, especially for verifying outcomes and user-visible states (see Lecture: Basics of UI Testing).
  - It aligns with the use-case-driven approach recommended in the course material.
  - Easier to maintain as UI changes, since tests focus on "what" rather than "how".
- **Imperative testing** is still necessary for simulating user actions (e.g., filling forms, clicking buttons), as shown in Tutorial 3: GUI Testing with Cypress.
  - Most real-world Cypress tests combine both: imperative for actions, declarative for assertions.

**Conclusion:**
- Use imperative style for simulating user interactions.
- Use declarative style for assertions and outcome verification.
- This hybrid approach is recommended in the course Tutorials and Lectures for robust, maintainable UI tests.
